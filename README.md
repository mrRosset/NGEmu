# NGEmu
NGEmu is a HLE N-Gage emulator written in C++.

IRC channel: #ngemu on freenode

## Status
Developing the emulator is suspended, while we research the system and gather information required to create one.

If you've got any hints, resources or information regarding the N-Gage, Symbian or projects related to it, which we don't already have (check [the wiki](https://github.com/NGEmu/NGEmu/wiki)), then please contact us either through IRC by joining #ngemu on freenode and pinging madaal or tambre, or by sending an email to ![picture of e-mail address](https://i.imgur.com/kYKjQnQ.png).

That said, the NGEmu emulator has some basic CPU emulation and some basic system functions HLE'd.

## System Requirements
* Modern 64-bit CPU
* Vulkan compatible graphics card
* 64-bit OS

## Compiling
NGEmu can be currently only compiled using Visual Studio 2015 on a Windows computer. Linux support is planned for the future.
